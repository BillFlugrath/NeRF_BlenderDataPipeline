This project is used to create training data for a Neural Radiance Field ie NeRF demo application.  This demo can be found either:

They contain amazing information on the theory of NeRFs and how the code works.  The demo includes training data which is perfect for learning how NeRFs work.  If you wish to create new training data for the demo,
and continue experimentation, then this project can help with that.The demo comes with a file "tiny_nerf_data.npz" that is used for training. To use new training data, we simply need to make a new
npz file that has the new data.    

How To Create New Training Data:

The NeRF application loads all of its training data in a single npz file.  This file contains three sections:

a) The images used for training
b) The camera poses (i.e. view matrices) used for training
c) A camera intrinsic scalar value called "Focal" which is roughly the focal length.

The easiest way to create new training data is with Blender.  Thus, the high-level steps are:

1) Create a model in Blender with a camera that animates 360 degrees around the model.
2) Output an image sequence of the camera output at each camera pose.  This will be a folder containing images named in sequence such as image000.png, image001.png, image002.png etc.
3) Run a python script in Blender that generates an npz file that contains all of the camera poses, with one pose for each frame (and therefore one pose per output image).

See the "readme_by_bill.txt" file in the Blender folder for detailed instructions.

At this point, copy the exported image sequence and "camera_poses.npz" file to the folder where the "create_npz_files_app.py"script exists.  Open the python script, "create_npz_files_app.py" and set the input filenames, images sizes, etc.  Then run the script.  The output will be a single npz file ready to be used for training.
